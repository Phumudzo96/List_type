# List_type

Imagine you want to store the names of three of your f riends in a list of
strings. Create a list variable called f riends_names, and write the syntax to
store the full names of three of your f riends.

Now, write statements to print out the name of the ﬁrst f riend, then the
name of the last f riend, and ﬁnally the length of the list.

Now, deﬁne a list called f riends_ages that stores the age of each of your
f riends in a corresponding manner, i.e., the ﬁrst entry of this list is the age
of the f riend named ﬁrst in the other list.
